Title: Happy 2021, goodbye and good riddance to 2020

Happy New Year!  This year in particular might be even happier than most, since we can officially close the books on 2020.

I had been planning to post more often, but when Covid hit and I was isolating at home my priorities shifted.  For quite a while I wasn't playing at all, but that did change over the course of the year.  Ever time I thought about writing last year I decided against it; my original plans for content had been centered around the NABCs, which were all canceled.

I decided towards the end of the year that I wanted to resume with writing, so the new year seemed like the perfect time to kick off a "soft reboot" of the site.  I'm not planning on deleting any of the content which was already posted, but I do want to add to that content - hopefully with some regularity.

Keep an eye out for new content, especially some videos!  I'm excited to try dipping my feet into making some video content.  I have one which is currently a work in progress, but hopefully as I learn the ropes of video creation / editing it will be easier for me to create videos going forward.
