You hold:

| ----- | -----: | -------- |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | \s | KQ532 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | \h | 85 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | \d | 7 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | \c | AKJ83 |

What do you open?

Apparently this hand appears in the Seattle Times today. The author of that article suggests opening 1\c and rebidding \s twice. This post is a counterpoint opinion.

There was a time when the mainstream recommendation was to open 1\c on this hand, but that time has long past?  Why?  In a nutshell &mdash; 2/1.

Consider the following auction in Standard American:

| Opener | | Responder |
| :--------: | :------: | :--------: |
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3\c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  |  |


If 2\d is 10+ and forcing 1 round, then 3\c commits to game. I would argue that the example hand is strong enough to do so, but let's weaken it a touch to be more in line with the modern game:


| | | |
| ----- | -----: | -------- |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | \s | KQ532 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | \h | 85 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | \d | 7 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | \c | AQ983 |

11 HCP, but 3 distributional points (1 doubleton, 1 singleton). This also meets the "Rule of 20" where we add the length of our 2 longest suits plus our HCP and open if it is 20 or more - this is 21. In any event, this is certainly an opening bid by modern standards.

In SA, the 1\s--2\d auction becomes problematic; we hardly want to GF this hand opposite a random 10 count, especially with some of that rating to be wasted in the diamond suit. This issue disappears when 2\d is a GF already; now we can bid 3\c freely based purely on our distribution without worrying about promising extra HCP strength.  Indeed, that is one of the strengths of 2/1 as compared with SA.

There are other issues with opening 1\c on hands like this as well. The plan of 1\c, then 1\s, then 2\s is all well and good when the opponents stay out of your way, but far too often that is no longer the case! Suppose you open 1\c and the next hand bids 4\h, which goes pass pass back to you. Perhaps you might bid 4\s, but are you comfortable doing so? Would it stun anyone if you were then doubled and go for a large number?

There's also the issue of using our best tools.  Over a 1\s opener we have:  Jacoby 2NT, spinters, Forcing NT, and so on. Over 1\c we have...crickets.  If the auction goes 1\c--3NT, do you now whip out 4\s? Is partner going to know that's meant as a sign off bid rather than a slam try?

There was a time when it was normal enough to open 1\c on this hand, but with the exception of a few hold outs to a bygone era this hand will be opened 1\s by any expert.
