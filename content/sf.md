Tomorrow kicks off the Fall NABC in San Francisco. While many Americans will be carving their turkeys and watching football, bridge players world wide will be making the journey to SFO.

This NABC is particularly exciting for me, as a new premier event is kicking off: the Soloway Teams. The inaugrial event starts with a 2-day swiss on Friday/Saturday, reducing to 32 teams for a KO format for the remainder. I had a hand in getting this event on the schedule and am looking forward to having another solid KO premier event. Win or lose from the swiss, I expect I will enjoy this event.

I will be attempting to post updates on thoughts & hands from the week as they happen.
