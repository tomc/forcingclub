While many Americans will be carving their turkeys and watching football, bridge players world wide will be making the journey to SFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This NABC is particularly exciting for me, as a new premier event is kicking off: the Soloway Teams. The inaugrial event starts with a 2-day swiss on Friday/Saturday, reducing to 32 teams for a KO format for the remainder. I had a hand in getting this event on the schedule and am looking forward to having another solid KO premier event. Win or lose from the swiss, I expect I will enjoy this event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be attempting to post updates on thoughts &amp;amp; hands from the week as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="NABC"></category></entry></feed>
